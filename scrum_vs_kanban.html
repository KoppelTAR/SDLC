          <p>From the research I conducted I would prefer Scrum over Kanban. In my opinion the pull system of scrum is more intuitive. Even if a few selected features are not built during a sprint cycle they are put back in the backlog to be later finished or started again. I think that rearranging tasks in Kanban can be confusing; If for example team 2 gets team 1's work and has to figure out how they developed that system it could cause delays in the development of said system. The only thing in my opinion that Kanban does better than Scrum is flexibility.</p>
