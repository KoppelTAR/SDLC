              <p>The Waterfall model is the oldest sdlc model. each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases. it consists of 5 stages:</p>
              <p>Waterfall model is used when requirements are stable and not changed frequently. An application is small. There is no requirement which is not understood or not very clear. Resources are well trained and are available.</p>
              <p>1: Requirement Gathering and analysis − All possible requirements of the system to be developed are captured in this phase and documented in a requirement specification document.</p>
              <p>2: System Design − The requirement specifications from first phase are studied in this phase and the system design is prepared. This system design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and helps in defining the overall system architecture.</p>
              <p>3: Implementation − With inputs from the system design, the system is first developed in small programs called units, which are integrated in the next phase. Each unit is developed and tested for its functionality, which is referred to as Unit Testing.</p>
              <p>4: Integration and Testing − All the units developed in the implementation phase are integrated into a system after testing of each unit. Post integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures. </p>
              <p>5: Deployment of system − Once the functional and non-functional testing is done; the product is deployed in the customer environment or released into the market.</p>
              <p>6: Maintenance − There are some issues which come up in the client environment. To fix those issues, patches are released. Also to enhance the product some better versions are released. Maintenance is done to deliver these changes in the customer environment.</p>

              <span class="close2">&times;</span>
              <p>In the Iterative model, iterative process starts with a simple implementation of a small set of the software requirements and iteratively enhances the evolving versions until the complete system is implemented and ready to be deployed.</p>
              <p>An iterative life cycle model does not attempt to start with a full specification of requirements. Instead, development begins by specifying and implementing just part of the software, which is then reviewed to identify further requirements. This process is then repeated, producing a new version of the software at the end of each iteration of the model.</p>
              <p>It consists of 3 stages per Iteration:</p>
              <p>1: Design and development</p>
              <p>2: Testing</p>
              <p>3: Implementation</p>

              <span class="close3">&times;</span>
              <p>Alternative to Waterfall model but  its no longer in use.</p>
              <p>The starting stages involve getting and defining the project requirements from the client. Multiple low fidelity prototypes are made for the client to collect early feedback.</p>
              <p>The Prototyping Model should be used when the requirements of the product are not clearly understood or are unstable.</p>

              <span class="close4">&times;</span>
              <p>The spiral model is a systems development lifecycle (SDLC) method used for risk management that combines the iterative development process model with elements of the Waterfall model.</p>
              <p>The spiral model is used by software engineers and is favored for large, expensive and complicated projects.</p>

              <span class="close5">&times;</span>
              <p>The V-model is a type of SDLC model where process executes in a sequential manner in V-shape.</p>
              <p>It is also known as Verification and Validation model. It is based on the association of a testing phase for each corresponding development stage.</p>
              <p>Development of each step directly associated with the testing phase.</p> 
              <p>The next phase starts only after completion of the previous phase.</p>
              <p>It is used to produce rigorous development lifecycle models and project management models.</p>

              <p>Agile SDLC model is a combination of iterative and incremental process models with focus on process adaptability and customer satisfaction by rapid delivery of working software product.</p>
              <p>Agile Methods break the product into small incremental builds. These builds are provided in iterations.</p>
              <p>Each iteration typically lasts from about one to three weeks.</p>
              <p>Agile consists of 6 steps:</p>
              <p>1: Requirements gathering</p>
              <p>2: Design the requirements</p>
              <p>3: Construction/iteration</p>
              <p>4: Testing/ Quality assurance</p>
              <p>5: Deployment</p>
              <p>6: Feedback</p>
